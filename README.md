A native keyboard-aware composer for React Native chat applications. Built specifically for AI chat interfaces like ChatGPT and v0, where content needs to react intelligently to keyboard and input changes.

> **Fork notice:** This is a maintained fork of [`@launchhq/react-native-keyboard-composer`](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/react-native-keyboard-composer) by [paulmbw](https://github.com/paulmbw), continued here because upstream is no longer actively maintained. Original work is MIT-licensed and all credit for the foundation goes to the original author — see [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments). This fork adds New Architecture support, production hardening, and ongoing maintenance.

## The Problem

In chat applications, keyboard handling is notoriously difficult:

- When should content push up vs the keyboard overlay content?
- How do you maintain the gap between the last message and composer as the input grows?
- What happens when the user scrolls while the keyboard is open, then closes it?

This library solves all of that with native implementations that handle the edge cases.

## Features

- 💬 **Built for chat UIs** - Content reacts correctly to keyboard open/close
- 📏 **Smart content positioning** - Knows when to push content up vs overlay
- ⌨️ **Auto-growing input** - Composer expands with text, content adjusts accordingly
- 🔄 **Scroll-to-bottom button** - Appears when you scroll away from latest messages
- 📱 **iOS & Android parity** - Same behavior on both platforms
- 🎛️ **Streaming support** - Built-in stop button for AI streaming responses
- 🌙 **Dark mode support** - Automatically adapts to system theme
- 👆 **Gesture support (iOS)** - Swipe down to dismiss keyboard, swipe up to open

> **Note:** Android support is still a WIP and may be buggy.
> **Note:** Currently supports React Native `ScrollView` only. Support for `FlashList` and `LegendList` is planned for later this year.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add react-native-chat-composer
# or
npm install react-native-chat-composer
# or
yarn add react-native-chat-composer
```

For Expo managed projects, run:

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```tsx
import {
  KeyboardComposer,
  KeyboardAwareWrapper,
} from "react-native-chat-composer";

function ChatScreen() {
  const [composerHeight, setComposerHeight] = useState(48);

  return (
    <KeyboardAwareWrapper style={{ flex: 1 }} extraBottomInset={composerHeight}>
      <ScrollView>{/* Your chat messages */}</ScrollView>

      <View style={styles.composerContainer}>
        <KeyboardComposer
          placeholder="Type a message..."
          onSend={(text) => handleSend(text)}
          onHeightChange={(height) => setComposerHeight(height)}
          onComposerFocus={() => console.log("Focused")}
          onComposerBlur={() => console.log("Blurred")}
        />
      </View>
    </KeyboardAwareWrapper>
  );
}
```

### With AI Streaming

```tsx
import { KeyboardComposer } from "react-native-chat-composer";

function AIChat() {
  const [isStreaming, setIsStreaming] = useState(false);

  const handleSend = async (text: string) => {
    setIsStreaming(true);
    await streamAIResponse(text);
    setIsStreaming(false);
  };

  return (
    <KeyboardComposer
      placeholder="Ask anything..."
      isStreaming={isStreaming}
      onSend={handleSend}
      onStop={() => cancelStream()}
    />
  );
}
```

### Dismissing Keyboard Programmatically

```tsx
const [blurTrigger, setBlurTrigger] = useState(0);

// Call this to dismiss keyboard
const dismissKeyboard = () => setBlurTrigger(Date.now());

<KeyboardComposer
  blurTrigger={blurTrigger}
  // ...other props
/>;
```

## API Reference

### `<KeyboardAwareWrapper />`

Wrapper component that handles keyboard-aware scrolling.

| Prop                 | Type                   | Default | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `pinToTopEnabled`    | `boolean`              | `false` | Enables pin-to-top + runway behavior (see below)     |
| `extraBottomInset`   | `number`               | `0`     | Bottom inset (typically the current composer height) |
| `scrollToTopTrigger` | `number`               | `0`     | Change value to arm pin-to-top for the next append   |
| `style`              | `StyleProp<ViewStyle>` | -       | Container style                                      |
| `children`           | `ReactNode`            | -       | Should contain a ScrollView                          |

#### Pin-to-top behavior (optional)

Pin-to-top is **opt-in** and is controlled via `KeyboardAwareWrapper` (not `KeyboardComposer`).

When `pinToTopEnabled` is `true`:

- The next user message append is **pinned to the top** of the viewport.
- A non-scrollable **runway** is created below it so streamed assistant responses can grow without the content snapping around.
- While streaming grows content, the wrapper keeps the pinned position stable unless the user manually scrolls away.

When `pinToTopEnabled` is `false` (or omitted), the wrapper behaves like a normal keyboard-aware chat wrapper (no runway/pinning).

You can toggle `pinToTopEnabled` at runtime; disabling it clears any active runway/pin state.

#### `scrollToTopTrigger`

Despite the name, `scrollToTopTrigger` is used to **arm pin-to-top for the next content append** (use a counter or `Date.now()`).

### `constants`

Module constants for default values:

```tsx
import { constants } from "react-native-chat-composer";

console.log(constants.defaultMinHeight); // 48
console.log(constants.defaultMaxHeight); // 120
console.log(constants.contentGap); // 32
```

## Styling & Customization

### Built-in Spacing

The library automatically handles spacing between your content and the composer:

| Constant                | iOS (pt) | Android (dp) | Description                           |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `CONTENT_GAP`           | 24       | 24           | Gap between last message and composer |
| `COMPOSER_KEYBOARD_GAP` | 8        | 8            | Gap between composer and keyboard     |

> **Note:** While both platforms use the same numerical values, the visual spacing may appear different due to how each platform handles safe areas, scroll content insets, and keyboard positioning. iOS typically shows more visible gap due to its safe area and scroll inset calculations.

### Adding Extra Spacing

If you need more space between your content and the composer, add `paddingBottom` to your scroll content:

```tsx
<ScrollView
  contentContainerStyle={{
    paddingBottom: 16, // Extra space above composer
  }}
>
  {/* Your messages */}
</ScrollView>
```

### Composer Container Styling

The `KeyboardComposer` should be placed inside `KeyboardAwareWrapper` with absolute positioning for proper keyboard animation:

```tsx
<KeyboardAwareWrapper style={{ flex: 1 }} extraBottomInset={composerHeight}>
  <ScrollView>{/* Content */}</ScrollView>

  {/* Composer - positioned absolutely, animated by native code */}
  <View style={styles.composerContainer}>
    <View style={[styles.composerWrapper, { height: composerHeight }]}>
      <KeyboardComposer ... />
    </View>
  </View>
</KeyboardAwareWrapper>

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  composerContainer: {
    position: 'absolute',
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    paddingHorizontal: 16,
    paddingBottom: 16, // Or use safe area insets
  },
  composerWrapper: {
    borderRadius: 24,
    backgroundColor: '#F2F2F7',
    overflow: 'hidden',
  },
});
```

### Hiding The Built-In Send Button

Use `showSendButton={false}` when you want to supply your own controls outside of `KeyboardComposer`.

```tsx
<KeyboardComposer
  placeholder="Type a message..."
  showSendButton={false}
  onChangeText={setDraft}
/>
```

## How It Works

The library handles three key scenarios:

1. **Keyboard opens** - Content pushes up to keep the last message visible above the composer
2. **Input grows/shrinks** - As you type multiple lines, content scrolls to maintain the gap between your last message and the composer
3. **Keyboard closes** - If you scrolled while the keyboard was open, content adjusts to prevent awkward gaps

### Technical Details

- **iOS**: Uses `keyboardLayoutGuide` (iOS 15+) with `CADisplayLink` for frame-accurate positioning
- **Android**: Uses `WindowInsetsAnimationCompat` for synchronized keyboard tracking

## Platform Support

| Platform | Support                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| iOS      | ✅ Native implementation |
| Android  | ✅ Native implementation |
| Web      | ❌ Not supported         |

## Gestures (iOS)

The composer supports intuitive swipe gestures on the input field:

| Gesture    | Action                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Swipe down | Dismisses the keyboard                   |
| Swipe up   | Focuses the input and opens the keyboard |

These gestures provide a natural way to control the keyboard without reaching for the keyboard dismiss button or tapping outside.

## Requirements

- React Native 0.71+
- Expo SDK 48+ (for Expo projects)
- iOS 15+
- Android API 21+

## Development

If you’re contributing to this repo (or running the `example/` app locally), see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for a clear breakdown of:

- Running the example against the **published npm package** (consumer mode)
- Running the example against the **local package source** (native development mode)

### Quick local iOS loop (`example/`)

From `example/`, this runs install, local prebuild, iOS build/run, then starts Metro in local mode:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm prebuild:local
pnpm ios:local
pnpm start:local
```

If you want the example app to use the local package while editing this repo, run:

```bash
pnpm use:local
```

### Local Development Setup

To test this package locally in another project:

---

#### Option A: Using npm/yarn (Simple)

This approach works with any package manager and doesn't require workspaces.

**1. Link to the local package in your `package.json`:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-chat-composer": "file:../react-native-keyboard-composer"
  }
}
```

> Adjust the path to point to where you cloned the package.

**2. Configure Metro to watch the external package:**

In your app's `metro.config.js`:

```js
const path = require("path");
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

// Path to the local package
const keyboardComposerPath = path.resolve(
  __dirname,
  "../react-native-keyboard-composer" // Adjust path as needed
);

// Watch the external package folder for changes
config.watchFolders = [keyboardComposerPath];

// Map the package name to the local path
config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
  "react-native-chat-composer": keyboardComposerPath,
};

module.exports = config;
```

**3. Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**4. Rebuild native code (required for native modules):**

```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:ios
# or
npx expo run:android
```

Now any changes to the package will be reflected immediately in your app.

---

#### Option B: Using pnpm Workspaces (Monorepo)

If you're using pnpm workspaces in a monorepo setup:

**1. Add the package to your workspace:**

In your project's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - apps/*
  - ../react-native-keyboard-composer # Adjust path as needed
```

**2. Use workspace protocol in `package.json`:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-chat-composer": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

**3. Configure Metro** (same as Option A step 2 above)

**4. Install dependencies:**

```bash
pnpm install
```

Now any changes to the package will be reflected immediately in your app.

### Publishing to npm

When you're ready to publish:

#### 1. Build and publish the package

```bash
cd react-native-keyboard-composer
pnpm run build
npm publish --access public
```

#### 2. Update consuming apps to use the published version

In the consuming app's `package.json`, change:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // From:
    "react-native-chat-composer": "workspace:*"

    // To:
    "react-native-chat-composer": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Clean up workspace config (optional)

Remove the package from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - apps/*
  # Remove: - ../react-native-keyboard-composer
```

#### 4. Reinstall dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Quick Toggle Scripts (Optional)

Add these scripts to your consuming app's `package.json` for easy switching:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "use-local-keyboard": "pnpm pkg set dependencies.react-native-chat-composer=workspace:* && pnpm install",
    "use-published-keyboard": "pnpm pkg set dependencies.react-native-chat-composer=^0.1.0 && pnpm install"
  }
}
```
